  <p>As students, it's essential to remember that our mental health matters just as much as our studies do.
    It's easy to get caught up in the pressures of academics, but taking care of ourselves
    is equally important. It's important to take some time to prioritize self-care, set realistic goals, manage our time effectively, try different study methods, and don't hesitate to seek support when needed.
    I want to let everyone now that feeling stressed out
    before an exam is normal, we all feel it most of the time, but we can't let that feeling overcome our well-being. We all got this and I promise that all this work one day will be worth it.
